# Shear Force and Bending Moment Diagram

The goal of this project was to create a dynamic website that plots shear force and bending moment diagrams to analyze material strength. We developed a thorough structural analysis tool using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Chart.js library. This project demonstrated our technical expertise and demonstrated the value of teamwork in solving engineering problems. We improved our web programming and problem-solving abilities while broadening our grasp of material strength through this endeavor.


## Features
Plot of SFD & BMD can be done for different type of forces like:
- Point Load 
- Uniform Load 
- Linear Load 



## Deployment

To Plot graphs, follow steps

```bash
  Home > Plot > Point Load || Uniform Load || Linear Load > Put Values > Plot Graph
```
